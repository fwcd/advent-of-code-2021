# Day 18

## Running

Make sure to have a recent Curry compiler installed, e.g. KiCS2 3 or PAKCS 3. Run

```bash
$CURRY cypm install
```

to install the dependencies then

```bash
$CURRY :load Main :eval main :quit
```

to run the program, where `$CURRY` is your compiler of choice, e.g. `kics2` or `pakcs`.
